## Structure
The basic structure of this challenge is given in the following way:

`node_modules/` Contains all dependencies fetched via NPM. However, this directory is unnecessary for versioning, so it is ignored.

`public/` Contains all the static files you use in your application, this is where you store your front-end files.

`.gitignore` The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

`package.json` Lists all Node.js dependencies.

`README.md` Explains how your application works.
